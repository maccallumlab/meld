        Compute the exchanges from a given energy matrix.

        Args:
            energies: numpy array of energies (see below for details)
            adaptor: replica exchange adaptor that is updated every attempted swap
        Returns:
            a permutation vector (see below for details)

        The energy matrix should be an n_rep x n_rep numpy array. All energies
        are in dimensionless units (unit of kT). Each column represents a
        particular structure, while each row represents a particular
        combination of temperature and Hamiltonian. So, ``energies[i,j]`` is
        the energy of structure j with temperature and hamiltonian i. The
        diagonal ``energies[i,i]`` are the energies that were actually
        simulated.

        This method will attempt ``self.n_trials`` swaps between randomly
        chosen pairs of adjacent replicas. It will return a permutation vector
        that describes which index each structure should be at after swapping.
        So, if the output was ``[2, 0, 1]``, it would mean that replica 0
        should now be at index 2, replica 1 should now be at index 0, and
        replica 2 should now be at index 1. Output of ``[0, 1, 2]`` would
        mean no change.

        The adaptor object is called once for each attempted exchange with the
        indices of the attempted swap and the success or failure of the swap.
