        Replica exchange adaptation works as follows. First `adaptation_burn_in` steps
        are run and no statistics about exchange are collected. Then `adaptation_adapt_every`
        steps are run and the average acceptance rate is calculated. Any acceptance rates
        below `adaptation_min_acc_prob` are clamped at the minimum. Then adaptation
        is performed to equalize the acceptance rates. After each adaptation, the values
        of `adaptation_burn_in` and `adaptation_adapt_every` are multiplied by
        `adaptation_growth_factor`.

    Note:
        If `n_trials` is `None`, then the number of trials is `n_replicas**2`.
